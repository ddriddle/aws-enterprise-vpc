## Inputs

variable "tags" {
  description = "A mapping of tags to assign to the module's resource(s)"
  default     = {}
}

variable "name" {
  description = "tag:Name for this VPN Connection"
}

variable "vpn_gateway_id" {
  description = "VPN Gateway to use for this VPN connection, e.g. vgw-abcd1234"
}

# Alarm must exist in same region as Metric, i.e. same region as global Lambda
#
# Unfortunately passing this in as a variable isn't currently supported (see
# https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/11578) so we have to hard-code
# it instead.
#variable "alarm_provider" {
#    description = "Optional provider (TYPE.ALIAS) for Alarm, e.g. aws.us-east-1"
#    default = "aws"
#}

# Unfortunately these generic list variables do not currently work
# (see https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/11453)
#variable "alarm_actions" {
#    description = "Optional list of actions (ARNs) to execute when the alarm transitions into an ALARM state from any other state, e.g. [arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:999999999999:vpn-monitor-topic]"
#    type = "list"
#    default = []
#}

#    description = "Optional list of actions (ARNs) to execute when the alarm transitions into an INSUFFICIENT_DATA state from any other state."
#    type = "list"
#    default = []
#}
#variable "ok_actions" {
#    description = "Optional list of actions (ARNs) to execute when the alarm transitions into an OK state from any other state."
#    type = "list"
#    default = []
#}
# so for now we accept a single ARN and add it to all three lists
variable "vpn_monitor_arn" {
  description = "SNS Topic for alarm to notify, e.g. arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:999999999999:vpn-monitor-topic"
